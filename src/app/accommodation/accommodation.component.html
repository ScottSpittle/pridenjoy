        <p>In the alcove opposite are fitted cupboards each with a digital padlock. Behind each of these doors are
          additional items you may request. For example, you may find that after a day spent on Bridlington's golden

          yourselves.
        </p>

      <mat-tab label="Wet Room">
        <p>For most individuals, particularly those with restricted mobility, such as the disabled and elderly, this
          area is of paramount importance. Therefore, you will be pleased to view and read about the fitments, which are
          comprehensive. A drop down shower chair is installed and full length mirrors have been strategically placed
          enabling you to view parts of your body you may need to place particular importance on keeping clean. Or just

          us, just select the required height on the Booking Form.
